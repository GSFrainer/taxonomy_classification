# A deep learning model for the classification of living organisms using the 18S rRNA segment of the genetic sequence

A Master's thesis project developing and evaluating a deep learning (CNN) approach for taxonomic classification of genetic sequences, with comparative analysis against QIIME2's feature-classifier plugin.

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the implementation and some experiments for a deep learning model, CNN based, designed to classify taxonomic information from 18S rRNA genetic sequences. The project compares the performance of the custom deep learning approach against the established QIIME2 feature-classifier plugin using data from the PR2 platform.

## ✅ Results Summary

The developed model consistently outperformed the reference tool in terms of accuracy across all classification levels, based on the dataset used. The table below presents the mean accuracies, while a more detailed comparison (including minimum, mean, and maximum values) can be found in the associated thesis document at the end of this page.
